# Breakout

## Breakout Strategy

Implement a strategy that seek to gain from the exit from a range-bound behaviour due to e.g., a significant news release or from market pressure from a large investor. The hypothesis is that liquidity traders who have been providing liquidity at the bounds of the range seek to cover their positions to mitigate losses, thus magnifying the move out of the range, and the move out of the range attracts other investor interest; these investors, due to the behavioural bias of herding (e.g., Herd Behavior) build positions which favor continuation of the trend.

A test for significance (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test) is performed with and without outliers.
